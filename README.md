Here you will find projects related to finance and the stock market. The two things I would like to do initially are:

1. Portfolio optimization.
2. Building algorithmic trading strategies.

My end goal would be to build a completely automated trading strategy for swing trading.

The Wikipedia page on portfolio optimization is a good starting point (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portfolio_optimization) to understand what this is about. Essentially, we want to maximize expected return while minimizing financial risk.
